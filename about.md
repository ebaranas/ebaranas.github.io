Hi! I'm Filipina currently based in London where I recently obtained my PhD in Physics. My interests lie in stochastic and quantum dynamics, and machine learning.

This blog is primarily to help me remember things, but if you pick up something useful then great!

Also, this site is freshly made, so please bear with me while I polish my blogging workflow. Cheers!
